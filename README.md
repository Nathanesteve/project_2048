## Topic

The goal of this project is to be able to reproduce a videogame : 2048. The game must be playable.  
Test the original game at *https://play2048.co/*

After what we want to know if there are strategies to take the game further like the following strategies:

+ random movement
+ right movement
+ left movement
+ clockwise movement

To do so, we will need to launch many games to test the different cases (Monte-Carlo), so, it will be interesting to parallelize the process.
