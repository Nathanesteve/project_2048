## Topic

The goal of this project is to be able to reproduce a video game : 2048. The game must be playable.  
Test the original game at *<https://play2048.co/>*

After what we want to know if there are strategies to take the game further like the following strategies:

+ random movement
+ right movement
+ left movement
+ clockwise movement
+ other movement pattern

To do so, we will need to launch many games to test the average score. We will make a visual game and visual representation about different strategy.
If we have time we will try different game rules (probability change, size grid)
