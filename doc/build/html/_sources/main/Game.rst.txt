To play this version of the game you just need a keyboard, and for greater comfort an *AZERTY* binded one.

Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You may type in a python shell the follwing lines, after what the game will start:

.. code-block:: python

    import Main
    Main.Launchgame()

The keys are the following :

    - z : up

    - q : left

    - d : right

    - s : down

    :members: demo, display, down_movement, inverse, left_movement, main, maxcell_find, merge_left,
        newcell, newcell_start, possible_action, right_movement, stack, stop_game, sup_2048, transpose, up_movement


Graphic interface version
